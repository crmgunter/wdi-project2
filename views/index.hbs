            <p>Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up
with other websites. You could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text
coming out of her wherever. I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have
a very good brain and I've said a lot of things.</p>

      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and
I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's
not nice." Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the
text of your next webpage?! When other websites give you text, they’re not
sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots
of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing
mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume,
are good words.
          My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various
other parts of my website. My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well
